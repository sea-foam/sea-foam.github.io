		<h1>our philosophy:</h1>
		<ul style="color: white;">
			<li>
				<h3>Emphasis</h3>
				<p>
					if you're making a toaster, emphasize its ability to make toast, and de-emphasize everything else.
					<br>it's better to be a great toaster than it is to be a bad camera that makes mediocre toast.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Simplicity</h3>
				<p>
					everyone knows how to make toast. insert bread, push the plunger down.
					<br>don't make a bluetooth connected toaster that can only be activated via companion app. if my
					phone breaks,
					or the app gets a bad update, or something happens inside the toaster, not only can I not make toast
					anymore,
					but I have to diagnose which of the 3 is causing the issue before I can get to fixing it.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Parts</h3>
				<p>
					parts should be replaceable, and <b>things</b> should be made to be repaired.
					<br>if a part of a <b>thing</b> breaks, it should be easier to replace that part than it is to
					replace the <b>thing</b>.
					<br>if your <b>thing</b> is made of many small, easy to make parts, and one breaks,
					that is still easier to fix than one large, hard to make part.
					<br>most importantly: make <b>things</b> in an easily understood way. if you wake up to a broken
					toaster,
					you want to understand why it is broken and how to fix it within minutes rather than days.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Place</h3>
				<p>
					<b>things</b> have a place.
					<br> a toaster is a great <b>thing</b>, but no matter how well it does its job it can't do
					everything.
					you could try to make breakfast using just a toaster, but it probably wouldn't go well.
					however, if you combine many <b>things</b>, like your toaster, a stove, a refrigerator, some pans,
					and dishes
					(which are also all made to do their job well), you'll have made an incredible breakfast
					(which is also a new <b>thing</b>)!
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Beauty</h3>
				<p>
					make beautiful <b>things</b>.
					<br>make <b>things</b> that are wonderful, make <b>things</b> that are simple, make <b>things</b> that you are proud of.
					make <b>things</b> that will change the world. make <b>things</b> that will never see the light of day.
					<br>just make <b>things</b>, and if you follow the advice above, your <b>thing</b> will be beautiful. 
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
